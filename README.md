- Should have
	- Comments forum for specific homework shown
	- File download functionality

- Won't have
	- Teachers able to see more resources: lesson plans, homeworks and practicals
	- Teachers able to see other teacher's resources.

## User Story and Wireframes

Wireframes were created using popapp (https://popapp.in/).

1. User is greeted by sign-in page (if not logged in)
2. After logging in, or if already logged in, user is directed to their profile page.
3. User can choose a homework that has been set.
4. User is directed to homwork show page where further information about the homework is displayed. User can download homework.
5. If the user is struggling with the homework they can switch to the forum page by using the drop down menu.
6. On forum page user can post comments/questions about the homework.

User can always be taken back to profile page by clicking on name at the top.

User can sign out by clicking on logout button.
